# Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my comprehensive data analytics portfolio showcasing hands-on projects in data analysis, ETL pipelines, machine learning, and business intelligence. This portfolio demonstrates expertise in Python, SQL, Power BI, and advanced analytics.

## Projects

### 1. 🌍 Global Air Pollution Data Analysis
**Technologies:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, APIs, Visualization

Analyzed global air pollution data for the world's 1,000 most populated cities using the OpenWeatherMap Air Pollution API. The project focused on:
- Automated API-based data collection (SO₂, NO₂, PM10, PM2.5, O₃, CO)
- Integration with city population and geographic data
- Regression and correlation analysis
- Interactive visualizations highlighting pollution trends

**Key Outputs:**
- Scatter plots and heatmaps identifying pollution patterns
- Map-based visualizations showing most/least polluted cities
- Statistical analysis of pollutant correlations
